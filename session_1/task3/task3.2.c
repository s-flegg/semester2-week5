// Week 5, session 1

/*
 * Task 3.2
 * Write a C program that calculates traffic violation fines
 * based on the type of violation and whether it is a repeat offense.
 *
 * Input:
 * - violation_type: an integer representing the violation type:
 *   1 → Speeding
 *   2 → Signal Jumping
 *   3 → Illegal Parking
 * - repeat_offense: an integer representing repeat offense status:
 *   0 → First-time offense
 *   1 → Repeat offense
 *
 * Output:
 * - Print the violation type such as "Violation: Speeding".
 * - Calculate and display the fine amount such as "Fine amount: xxx.xx".
 * - Apply a higher fine for repeat offenses. Repeat offenses incur a 100% fine increase (fine * 2).
 * - Print an error message for invalid violation types such as "Invalid violation type".
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Base fines:
 *   Speeding: 100
 *   Signal Jumping: 150
 *   Illegal Parking: 50
 * - The program must use a switch statement to process the violation type.
 *   
 * Example:
 * Input:
 * Enter violation type (1-Speeding, 2-Signal Jumping, 3-Illegal Parking): 1
 * Is this a repeat offense? (0-No, 1-Yes): 1
 *
 * Output:
 * Violation: Speeding
 * Repeat offense: Yes
 * Fine amount: 200.00
